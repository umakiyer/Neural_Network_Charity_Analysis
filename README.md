# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis:
With our knowledge of machine learning and neural networks,  used the features in the provided dataset to help Beks create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

### Results:
* Data Preprocessing:

    * What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
    IS_SUCCESSFUL- was the target variable.

    * What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?

         APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION,CLASSIFICATION,  USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION,INCOME_AMT, ASK_AMT 

    * What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

        EIN, NAME , STATUS, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS

* Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
    * How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did  you select for your neural network model, and why?
    The number of neuton used were 8
